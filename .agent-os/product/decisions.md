## 2025-07-26: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Created Jogo da Forca as an educational Portuguese hangman game with focus on clean design, privacy, and user experience. The product targets Portuguese language learners with a Notion-inspired interface and categorized vocabulary system.

### Context

The Portuguese language learning market lacks engaging, well-designed educational games. Most existing options are either outdated Flash games or generic word games not optimized for language learning. This creates an opportunity for a modern, privacy-focused solution.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Multi-language Word Game Platform**
   - Pros: Larger market, more content variety
   - Cons: Loss of focus, complex localization, diluted learning experience

2. **Mobile-First Native App**
   - Pros: Better performance, app store presence, device features
   - Cons: Development complexity, platform restrictions, update delays

3. **Full Learning Management System**
   - Pros: Comprehensive solution, monetization options
   - Cons: Scope creep, requires backend, privacy concerns

### Rationale

Chose a focused single-page web application because:
- Immediate market entry with minimal complexity
- Zero infrastructure costs
- Complete user privacy
- Works on all devices without installation
- Can evolve based on user feedback

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Rapid development and deployment
- No ongoing server costs
- Complete user privacy
- Accessible to all users regardless of device

**Negative:**
- Limited to client-side features initially
- No built-in monetization
- Requires future architecture changes for multiplayer

## 2025-07-26: Single-File Architecture

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Implement the entire application in a single index.html file with inline CSS and JavaScript, avoiding any build process or external dependencies.

### Context

The project started as a rapid prototype and the single-file approach proved highly effective. Rather than refactoring into a traditional multi-file structure, we're embracing this as a deliberate architectural choice.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional Multi-file Structure**
   - Pros: Separation of concerns, easier version control
   - Cons: Requires build process, more complex deployment

2. **Modern Framework (React/Vue)**
   - Pros: Component reusability, ecosystem benefits
   - Cons: Build complexity, larger bundle size, learning curve

### Rationale

The single-file approach offers unique benefits:
- Zero build time
- Instant deployment anywhere
- Easy to share and embed
- Perfect for educational settings (can email the file)
- Reduces complexity for a focused application

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Maximum portability and simplicity
- No dependency management
- Works offline after first load
- Easy for others to learn from the code

**Negative:**
- Harder to collaborate on large features
- No code splitting or lazy loading
- Limited tooling support

## 2025-07-26: Privacy-First Design

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Legal, Users

### Decision

Operate entirely client-side with no data collection, user accounts, or server communication. Use only localStorage for preferences.

### Context

Educational applications often collect extensive user data for analytics and progress tracking. However, many users (especially in educational settings) have privacy concerns about data collection.

### Rationale

Privacy-first approach because:
- Builds trust with educational institutions
- No GDPR/COPPA compliance needed
- No security vulnerabilities from data breaches
- Aligns with educational ethics

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Complete user privacy
- No legal compliance overhead
- No server costs or maintenance
- Works in restricted network environments

**Negative:**
- No cloud sync between devices
- Limited analytics for improvement
- Difficult to add social features later

## 2025-07-26: Notion-Style Design System

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Design
**Stakeholders:** Design Lead, Product Owner

### Decision

Adopt Notion's design language with clean typography, subtle borders, and muted color palette rather than typical game aesthetics.

### Context

Educational games often use bright, cartoonish designs that can feel childish or overwhelming. Notion's design system has proven highly effective for productivity and learning applications.

### Rationale

Notion-style design because:
- Appeals to broader age range
- Reduces cognitive load
- Feels professional and trustworthy
- Stands out in educational game market

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Unique positioning in market
- Appeals to adult learners
- Consistent, maintainable design
- Natural dark mode support

**Negative:**
- Less appealing to young children
- May seem "boring" to some users
- Limited use of game-like visual rewards
