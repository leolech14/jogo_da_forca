## The Problem

### Limited Portuguese Learning Games

Most educational word games are English-focused, leaving Portuguese learners with few engaging options. Students resort to boring flashcards and repetitive exercises.

**Our Solution:** A beautifully designed hangman game specifically for Portuguese vocabulary learning.

### Lack of Categorized Learning

Traditional hangman games use random words without context, making it harder to build vocabulary systematically. Learning is less effective without thematic grouping.

**Our Solution:** Organized word categories (Animals, Fruits, Countries, Objects) for focused learning.

### Poor User Experience in Educational Games

Educational games often sacrifice design for functionality, resulting in outdated interfaces. This reduces engagement and makes learning feel like a chore.

**Our Solution:** Modern Notion-style design with smooth animations and intuitive controls.

## Differentiators

### Beautiful Notion-Style Design

Unlike typical educational games with dated interfaces, we provide a modern, clean design inspired by Notion. This results in higher engagement and a premium feel that appeals to all age groups.

Unlike cloud-based games that require accounts and track data, we operate entirely client-side with no data collection. This results in instant loading, offline capability, and complete user privacy.

### Dual Input Support
